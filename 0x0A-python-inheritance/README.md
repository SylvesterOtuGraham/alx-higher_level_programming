Class Instance Counter
Overview
The Class Instance Counter is a Python project designed to demonstrate various concepts related to classes, inheritance, and object-oriented programming. Through a series of classes and scenarios, it illustrates how instances are created, attribute initialization, and inheritance.

Features
Base Class (Base): Contains a class variable __nb_instances to count the number of instances created. Each instance is assigned a unique ID.
Subclass (User): Inherit from the Base class, showcasing inheritance and customization of initialization.
Attribute Initialization: Demonstrates different scenarios of attribute initialization and its effects on instance creation.
Instance Counting: Tracks the number of instances created for both the base class and its subclasses.
Usage Scenarios: Provides example usage scenarios to understand how instance counting and attribute initialization work in different situations.
Concepts Covered
Superclass, Baseclass, Parentclass: The Base class serves as the superclass or baseclass, while subclasses like User inherit from it.
Subclass: Classes like User inherit from the Base class, making them subclasses.
Inheritance: The project showcases inheritance where subclasses inherit attributes and methods from the superclass.
Overriding Methods/Attributes: Subclasses can override methods or attributes inherited from the base class.
Purpose of Inheritance: Illustrates the purpose of inheritance in code organization, reuse, and customization.
Built-in Functions (isinstance, issubclass, type, super): Demonstrates how to use these functions to check class relationships and object types.
How to Use
Clone the Repository: Clone the project repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the Directory: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the project is cloned.
Run the Script: Execute the Python script instance_counter.py.
Observe Output: Observe the output printed to the console, which demonstrates various scenarios of class instance creation and attribute initialization.
Requirements
Python Scripts: The Python scripts should follow certain conventions regarding file structure, formatting, and execution.
Documentation: All classes, methods, and functions should be documented following specified guidelines.
Test Cases: Test cases are provided to ensure the functionality of the implemented classes and methods.
Dependencies
Python Version: The project is developed and tested using Python 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
Code Style: The code follows the PEP 8 style guide and is checked using the pycodestyle tool.
